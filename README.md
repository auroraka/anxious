# anAnxiousProject3

~~Upgraded~~ version of **aNervousProject2**.

This repository holds our team project in *Digital Logic Circuit Design*. Team 
members are:

- Wei Yilong
- Yang Tianlong
- Hu Zecong

Initials of our names "WYH" can be interpreted as "I'm nervous too" in Pinyin, 
and so goes our team name.

## Outline

Our project aims to build a 3D CAD system, with which the user can build 3D 
models as if they were creating an object in the real world. Specifically, the
user can draw in the air with a pen-like device and construct 3D models using 
the device, and then observe the model through a movable screen with cameras 
attached to the back (think of it as AR glasses, which obviously we're unable 
to build or even obtain).
